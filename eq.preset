##This is a Jazz preset for audacious, I have found that lowering the preamp lowers the distortion, I am not an audiophile of any kind.

##HOW TO USE: 
## 1. go to ~/.config/audacious
## 2. open the file "eq.preset" in a text editor
## 3. paste the text above the hashed text in the file, preferebly at the end of the file.
## 4. add "PresetX=Jazz" to the list at the top of the file, with "X" replaced with the next number in the list (audacious counts from 0 onwards)
## EXAMPLE:
###Preset0=Rock
###Preset1=Classic
###Preset2=UrMum
###Preset3=Jazz
